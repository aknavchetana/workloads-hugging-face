step to run:
1-install the dependency in the requirements file.
2-run the desired file using following command for model size and inference time.
   ->python3 keyword_spotting.py

for model training and testing->


for installation of  s3prl library link:https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl


i)-Prepare data
  Download data

   http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz
   http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_test_set_v0.01.tar.gz
ii)- Download and unpack Speech Commands

  mkdir -p /CORPORA_DIR/speech_commands_v0.01
  tar zxf speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz -C /CORPORA_DIR/speech_commands_v0.01
  Download and unpack Speech Commands test set

  mkdir -p /CORPORA_DIR/speech_commands_test_set_v0.01
  tar zxf speech_commands_test_set_v0.01.tar.gz -C /CORPORA_DIR/speech_commands_test_set_v0.01


iii)- Change the following path in downstream/speech_commands/config.yaml to yours

   downstream_expert:
      datarc:
         speech_commands_root: "/CORPORA_DIR/speech_commands_v0.01/"
          speech_commands_test_root: "/CORPORA_DIR/speech_commands_test_set_v0.01/"

iv)-Training
   python3 run_downstream.py -n ExpName -m train -u fbank -d speech_commands

v)-Testing
  python3 run_downstream.py -m evaluate -e result/downstream/ExpName/dev-best.ckpt
